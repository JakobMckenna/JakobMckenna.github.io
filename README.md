## Purpose
#### The purpose of this tutorial is to :
1. guide you on how to create your own website hosted on github pages
2. show you how to add a theme to your website
3. educate on the principles of good technical writing

## Prerequisites 
#### Before starting this tutorial users must first have:
* A resume formatted in markdown
* A GitHub account
* Know the basics of markdown (If you need some help, check out [this](https://www.markdowntutorial.com) tutorial)
* Have a markdown editor (I recommend [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com) for mac users)

I won't be going over how to create a proper resume in this guide, but if you need some help there are plenty of online tools that can help!

## Instructions
* For this section, it is assumed that you already have an GitHub account

#### Step one: Creating a repository for github pages
1. Log into your github account 
2. At the top right of GitHub, click the + button, then select "Create new repository" 
3. Name the repository the same name as your GitHub account
* If you name your repository the same name as your GitHub account, then GitHub will automatically create your website
4. Edit the settings to your liking
* I recommend keeping your repository public so that anybody can see it
* Adding a ReadMe is always helpful, even if it just does some simple explainations
5. Click on "Create Repository" and you are done this step!

####Step two: Uploading your files
* By now you should have:
* Created repository with your GitHub name as its name
* A resume in Markdown language

* Next, we can upload our resume to the repository by following these steps:
1. 



1. Create a new repository with your github username as the name
2. Upload your three files: _config.yml, readme.md, and resume.md
3. Your site will be generared using github pages
4. Etter says that. using static sites are better because they are hosted locally
